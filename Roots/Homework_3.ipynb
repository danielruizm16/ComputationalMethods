    "The Halley's method is a root-finding algorithm that uses both the first and second derivatives of a function to achieve cubic convergence. Based on the following steps, write a function that calculates the root of a function. Test it to find the first positive root of $f(x)=\\sin{(x)} +\\cos{(1+x^2)}-1$. Examine the convergence as a function of the tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:**\n",
    "    Start with an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs.\n",
    "    - Start with an initial guess $x0$ close to the suspected root.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iteration Formula:**\n",
    "    - At each iteration, evaluate $ f(x_n) $, $ f'(x_n) $, and $ f''(x_n) $.\n",
    "    - Compute the next approximation $x_{n+1}$ using the formula:\n",
    "    $$x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{2f(x_n)f'(x_n)}{2[f'(x_n)]^2 - f(x_n)f''(x_n)}$$\n",
    "    This formula is derived from the second-order Taylor expansion and provides cubic convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence Check:**\n",
    "   - Evaluate $ f(x_{n+1}) $.\n",
    "   - If $ |f(x_{n+1})| < \\text{tolerance} $ or $ |x_{n+1} - x_n| < \\text{tolerance} $, then $ x_{n+1} $ is the approximate root.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, set $ x_n = x_{n+1} $ and repeat the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stopping Criteria**:\n",
    "   - The iteration stops when either the function value is sufficiently close to zero or the change in the approximate root is smaller than a specified tolerance.\n",
    "   - A maximum number of iterations should also be specified to prevent infinite loops.\n"
